This repository showcases a simple ASCII shader applied to your webcam feed or a video uploaded to your browser.

The technical approach is based on [Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t)'s [I Tried Turning Games Into Text YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg40RWiaHRY&t=686s). Shout out to him!

Enjoy!
